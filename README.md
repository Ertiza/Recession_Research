📉 Recession Prediction Model
🔍 A Data-Driven Approach to Forecasting Economic Recessions Using Key Financial Indicators

📌 About the Project
This project aims to analyze historical economic data and develop a Recession Prediction Model using key financial indicators. By examining patterns before past recessions, we aim to identify early warning signs of economic downturns.

📊 Features & Methodology
✅ Data Collection:

Fetching economic indicators from FRED API (Federal Reserve Economic Data).
Key datasets include GDP Growth, Unemployment Rate, Yield Curve, Stock Market Trends, and Consumer Confidence.
✅ Data Processing & Analysis:

Time-series resampling and feature engineering.
Identifying patterns in economic data before and during recessions.
✅ Recession Indicators Used:

Yield Curve Inversion (10-Year minus 2-Year Treasury Yield Spread)
Unemployment Rate Spikes
Stock Market Trends (S&P 500 Performance)
Consumer Sentiment Index Declines
Industrial Production Index Slowdowns
✅ Machine Learning & Forecasting (Future Enhancements):

Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM models to predict recession probabilities.
✅ Visualization & Insights:

📈 Plotting Yield Curve trends and highlighting inverted yield periods.
📉 Comparing economic indicators before and during recessions.
